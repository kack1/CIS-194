* CIS 194
This is my poor attempt at University of Pennsylvania’s CIS 194 course.  It is online for free at [[University of Pennsylvania’s CIS 194][https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html]].

* Notice
I do not claim any writes to this course nor it's content.  I am just storing my lousy attempt of learning Haskell. This is not an complete collection (some stuff in week 4 is missing).
