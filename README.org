* CIS 194
This is my poor attempt at the University of Pennsylvania’s CIS 194 course.  It is online for free at [[https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html][University of Pennsylvania’s CIS 194]].

* Notice
I do not claim any writing to this course, nor its content.  I am just storing my lousy attempt at learning Haskell. This is a partial collection (some stuff in week four needs to be included).
